To use the template script:

Save it as create-service.sh
Make it executable: chmod +x create-service.sh
Run it with your service name: ./create-service.sh video-service


The script will create a new directory with all the necessary files for a new microservice. You'll just need to:

Update the content type in the Resource class to match your service (e.g., "video/mp4")

Add your media files to the appropriate resources directory
Build and run with Maven or Docker
